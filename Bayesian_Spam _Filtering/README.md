In this problem you will apply the na ̈ıve Bayes classifier to the problem of spam detection, using a benchmarkdatabase assembled by researchers at Hewlett-Packard

Here x is n×d, where n= 4601 andd= 57.  The different features correspond to different properties of anemail, such as the frequency with which certain characters appear. y is a vector of labels indicating spam ornot spam.  For a detailed description of the dataset, visit the UCI Machine Learning Repository, or Google’spambase’.

To evaluate the method, treat the first 2000 examples as training data, and the rest as test data.  Fit the na ̈ıve Bayes model using the training data (i.e., estimate the class-conditional marginals), and compute them is classification rate (i.e., the test error) on the test data.  The code above randomly permutes the data, sothat the proportion of each class is about the same in both training and test data.
